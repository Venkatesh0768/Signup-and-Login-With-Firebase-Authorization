# Signup-and-Login-With-Firebase-Authorization


User Sign-Up:
I implemented a sign-up page where users can register by entering their details. The information is then securely stored in Firebase, with the username acting as a unique identifier.

User Login:
The login page allows existing users to sign in by providing their username. The app checks Firebase to verify if the user exists before granting access.
